# Apple Health Extractor and Data Analysis

The repo was cloned a level up from the apple health branch
Put export.xml in data folder
Ran the parser
	python3 apple-health-data-parser.py data/export.xml
and volia, bunches of .csv files
edited README.md
git pull origin master
git push --set-upstream origin master
git commit -a -m "ready for pushing readme"
git push --all
saved again to update readme
git commit -a -m "ready for pushing readme third time"
git push --all

So, the above shows initial push, then subsequent pushes.
I'm doing another push to get this text up, then done for now.
